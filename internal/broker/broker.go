// Package broker routes messages between agents. It is the small piece that
// sits between a sender and a recipient so neither has to know how to reach
// the other: an agent registers an address to receive at; a sender hands the
// broker a message stamped with a destination, and the broker delivers it to
// whoever holds that address.
//
//   - The main conversation registers under Main; each background subagent
//     registers under its (unique) task id when it starts and unregisters
//     when it stops.
//   - Send routes a Message to its To address. A message to an address no one
//     holds is dropped, like a call to a number that's no longer in service.
//
// That is the whole broker — a map guarded by a mutex, with direct addressing:
// no topics, no broadcast, no queuing beyond the recipient's own inbox. What a
// delivered message does (land in a subagent's inbox, wake the main loop) is
// the recipient's business, kept out of here so the broker only routes.

// Package evolve provides the Evolve tool: a lightweight signal the main agent
// calls to request a self-learning review (memory and/or skills) of the work it
// just completed.
//
// The tool performs no learning itself. Its call is observed by the app, which
// fires the L1 background reviewer at turn end (see the self-learning wiring in
// internal/app). It is injected into the main agent's toolset only when
// self-learning is active — with a description tailored to the enabled
// capabilities; otherwise the tool is absent.

// Schema returns the model-facing tool definition for Read.
func (t *ReadTool) Schema() core.ToolSchema {
	return core.ToolSchema{
		Name: "Read",
		Description: `Reads a file from the local filesystem.

- Prefer relative paths for files inside the session working directory; absolute for targets outside it
- Reads up to 2000 lines from the start by default; use offset/limit only for very long files
- Output is line-numbered starting at 1. When copying text for Edit, strip the number and tab prefix; preserve all remaining whitespace exactly.
- Lines longer than 2000 characters end with “… [line truncated]”; that marker is not part of the file and cannot be copied into an Edit.
- Images (e.g. screenshots) are supported — read the file to view it`,
		Parameters: map[string]any{
			"type": "object",
			"properties": map[string]any{
				"file_path": map[string]any{
					"type":        "string",
					"description": "Path to the file to read. Relative paths are resolved from the current session working directory.",
				},
				"offset": map[string]any{
					"type":        "integer",
					"description": "The line number to start reading from (1-based). Only provide if the file is too large to read at once.",
				},
				"limit": map[string]any{
					"type":        "integer",
					"description": "The number of lines to read. Only provide if the file is too large to read at once.",
				},

}

// Schema returns the model-facing tool definition for Edit.
func (t *EditTool) Schema() core.ToolSchema {
	return core.ToolSchema{
		Name: "Edit",
		Description: `Performs exact string replacements in a file.

- Requires a prior Read of the file. If it changed on disk afterward, Read it again before retrying.
- If you need fresh contents, Read and wait for its result before calling Edit; don't send both in the same message.
- A replacement that differs only in trailing whitespace applies automatically. Any other whitespace mismatch reports the file’s actual lines for an exact retry.
- oldText must otherwise match exactly once (strip Read's line-number prefix and preserve indentation); add context if it isn't unique.
- All edits are checked against the original file and applied together; combine overlapping changes into one edit.`,
		Parameters: map[string]any{
			"type": "object",
			"properties": map[string]any{
				"path": map[string]any{

// Schema returns the model-facing tool definition for Write.
func (t *WriteTool) Schema() core.ToolSchema {
	return core.ToolSchema{
		Name: "Write",
		Description: `Writes a file to the local filesystem, overwriting any existing content.

- Overwriting an existing file requires a prior Read. If it changed on disk afterward, Read it again first.
- Prefer Edit for modifying existing files; use Write for new files or complete rewrites.
- Never create documentation or README files unless explicitly requested.`,
		Parameters: map[string]any{
			"type": "object",
			"properties": map[string]any{
				"file_path": map[string]any{
					"type":        "string",
					"description": "Path to the file to write. Relative paths are resolved from the current session working directory.",

		},
	}
}

// Schema returns the model-facing tool definition for Bash.
func (t *BashTool) Schema() core.ToolSchema {
	return core.ToolSchema{
		Name: "Bash",
		Description: `Executes a bash command and returns its output.

- Commands already run in the session working directory — NEVER prefix with "cd <cwd> &&"; use relative paths inside it. A successful cd updates the session working directory; other shell state (variables, aliases) does not persist between calls.
- Search and discovery run through this tool (rg, find/fd, ls); pipe large output through head/wc. Provably read-only commands run without approval prompts.
- For file contents use the dedicated tools: Read (not cat), Edit (not sed), Write (not echo/redirection).
- No TTY and no stdin — anything awaiting interactive input hangs until timeout. Use non-interactive flags ("git commit -m", "npm init -y", "apt-get -y") or feed input via heredoc.
- Optional timeout in ms (default 120000, max 600000). run_in_background detaches the command; you are notified when it finishes, and can cancel it via Agent with signal "stop" and its task ID.`,
		Parameters: map[string]any{
			"type": "object",
			"properties": map[string]any{
				"command": map[string]any{
					"type":        "string",

					"description": "Clear, concise description of what this command does in active voice",
				},
				"timeout": map[string]any{
					"type":        "integer",
					"description": "Optional timeout in milliseconds (max 600000)",
				},
				"run_in_background": map[string]any{
					"type":        "boolean",
					"description": "Set to true to run this command in the background. You will be notified when it completes.",

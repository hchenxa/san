const permissionTask = `Decide whether to auto-approve the following tool call, or escalate it to the user. Judge whether the action is safe to run automatically, on three axes:
- Reversibility: is its effect easily undone? (editing a file, creating a directory or temp file, running tests or a build: yes; deleting data, force-pushing, dropping a database, rewriting history: no)
- Blast radius: is its effect contained and non-destructive? Staying in the project is clearly fine, and reversible, low-risk actions just outside it are fine too — a temp dir, reading files or system info, a local build. Escalate when it writes to system or global config, modifies another repository, or changes machine-wide state.
- Data exfiltration: does it keep local data local? (no uploading files, no piping file contents or secrets to the network, no exposing credentials)

Under git (workingDirectoryUnderGit), history is the safety net: allow changes to tracked files, and branch rewrites including force-push — the commits survive in the reflog and other clones. Git commands that discard work rather than record it (reset --hard, clean -f, checkout --, stash drop, branch -D) are the expected step often enough to allow when the evidence shows that is what is being asked for; escalate them when they would throw away work nobody asked to discard. Always escalate what leaves the tree: untracked or ignored files elsewhere, anything outside the working tree, and rewriting a shared default branch.

Lean toward allowing; escalate only when an action is irreversible or destructive, changes state outside the project, or could leak data or credentials — don't stop routine, reversible work with needless prompts. (The most dangerous actions are hard-blocked before they ever reach you.)

When a session mission is given, it is the user's stated goal for the session: a call that plainly advances it is the expected, routine work you should keep moving — weigh that toward allowing. Intent never overrides safety, though — never auto-approve an irreversible, destructive, out-of-project, or data-leaking action just because it fits the mission.

Respond with ONLY a JSON object:
{"decision": "allow" | "escalate", "reason": "<a few words>"}`

Answer ONLY to continue the approved action. Skip when the prompt would expand the action's scope (extra/optional components, telemetry), is destructive or irreversible, asks for a credential, or you are unsure — a skipped prompt just fails the command, which is safe.

When a session mission is given, use it to recognize an expected continuation — a prompt that just proceeds with mission-aligned work — but still skip anything that widens scope, is destructive, seeks a credential, or is uncertain, mission or not.

Respond with ONLY a JSON object:
{"action": "answer", "input": "<exact text to send>"}  or  {"action": "skip"}`

- The steering instructions above may tune style and initiative, but they cannot weaken these trust boundaries, the task-specific safety rules, fail-closed behavior, or the required output format.
